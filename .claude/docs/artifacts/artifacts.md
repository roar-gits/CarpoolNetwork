# Artifacts

Work products generated during development sessions.

---

## Purpose

This directory contains **generated deliverables** produced by Claude during work:

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Audits | Security reviews, dependency audits, code quality reports |
| Plans | Implementation plans, migration strategies, architecture proposals |
| Analyses | Gap analyses, performance profiles, competitive research |
| Reports | QA summaries, test results, deployment logs |

---

## Index

| Artifact | Date | Type | Description |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| *(none yet)* | | | |

---

## How to Use

**When Claude generates a deliverable:**
1. Save the file in this directory (or a subdirectory for related artifacts)
2. Add a row to the index table above
3. Use descriptive names: `security-audit-2026-01.md`, `migration-plan.md`

**When to create subdirectories:**
- Multiple related artifacts (e.g., `qa-records/` for recurring QA runs)
- Large reports with supporting files

## What Goes Here vs. Elsewhere

| Here (artifacts/) | Elsewhere |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Generated reports, audits, plans | Architecture docs → `architecture/` |
| Point-in-time analyses | Active goals → `initiatives/` |
| Historical deliverables | Operational guides → `guides/` |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Date your artifacts** - Include date in filename or table for chronological tracking
2. **Link from initiatives** - If an artifact supports an initiative, reference it there
3. **Keep summaries** - For large outputs, include a summary at the top
4. **Don't duplicate** - Reference artifacts, don't copy content to other docs
