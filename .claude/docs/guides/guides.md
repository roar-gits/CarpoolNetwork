## Key Guides

| Guide | Purpose |

| [session-bootstrap.md](~/.claude/docs/guides/session-bootstrap.md) | Project initialization and session startup |

## Why Central?

Guides are **framework-level** documentation - they apply across all projects. Centralizing them:

1. **Avoids duplication** - one source of truth
2. **Simplifies updates** - change once, applies everywhere
3. **Saves context** - no redundant content in project docs

## Project-Specific Procedures

If this project needs **unique** operational procedures (not covered by main guides), add them below.

_None yet - add project-specific procedures here as needed._
